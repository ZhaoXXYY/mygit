Hello, teachers. I’m sorry I didn’t finish all the questions. Since it was the opening report of my school graduation thesis these days, my time was tight. Question1 and Question3 needed more time to read the documents and make a good summary, so I didn’t finish them. But I did my best to complete the Question2, and the results were attached to the file I submitted. I learned a lot from the written test, and from the documentation provided in the questions. Once I’ve submitted my answers, I’ll continue to read questions 1 and 3, and I’ll reflect on them and summarize them.
